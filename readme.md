```

## üöÄ Quick start

### 1) Set up the environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate          # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt    # or: pip install django mysqlclient
```

### 2) Database

The app works with SQLite out of the box.

To use MariaDB or MySQL set this in `settings.py` then run migrations. Django will create the tables for you.

```python
DATABASES = {
  "default": {
    "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.mysql",
    "NAME": "sticky_notes",
    "USER": "appuser",
    "PASSWORD": "yourpassword",
    "HOST": "127.0.0.1",
    "PORT": "3306",
    "OPTIONS": {
      "charset": "utf8mb4",
      "init_command": "SET sql_mode='STRICT_TRANS_TABLES'",
    },
    "CONN_MAX_AGE": 60,
  }
}
```

Install the driver if you switch to MariaDB or MySQL:

```bash
pip install mysqlclient
```

### 3) Migrate and run

```bash
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
python manage.py runserver
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:8000/

## üîê Authentication and URLs

Project urls

- `/login/` uses Django `LoginView` with a custom template
- `/logout/` uses Django `LogoutView`
- `/password/change/` uses a custom view that redirects to Profile with a success message
- `/account/` shows the Profile page
- `/account/edit/` lets you edit profile data

Notes app urls (namespace `notes:`)

- `notes:wall` shows the note wall
- `notes:create` creates a new note
- `notes:detail` shows a single note
- `notes:edit` edits a note
- `notes:delete` deletes a note with POST

Templates call urls by name. For example `{% url 'notes:wall' %}`. This keeps templates stable if mount points change.

---

## üß™ Tests

A simple suite lives in `notes/tests.py`.

- Model: `__str__` and ownership
- Form: required fields
- Views: wall requires login and CRUD for the owner and ownership guard for non owners

Run tests:

```bash
python manage.py test notes
```

You should see `OK` when they pass.

---

## üé® Front end notes

- Local time helper lives in `notes/static/notes/js/localtime.js`. Any `<time class="js-localtime" datetime="...">` is converted on the client
- Sticky look comes from `notes/static/notes/css/app.css`. Notes have a paper style with a small pin and a soft shadow

---

## üß≠ Developer notes

- Session cookies should be `Secure`, `HttpOnly` and set a suitable `SameSite`
- Rotate the session id on login to avoid fixation
- Notes are ordered newest first with model `Meta.ordering` or `.order_by('-updated_at')`
- Every note query filters by `user=request.user` so guessing ids returns a 404 for non owners
- Static analyzers may not see `user.notes` since Django creates it at runtime. You can query `StickyNote.objects.filter(user=user)` or add a small ignore comment

## üõ†Ô∏è Useful commands

```bash
# Create migrations after model changes then apply
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

# Collect static files for deployment
python manage.py collectstatic
```
